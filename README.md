commodore64emulator
===================

This repository contains three versions of my C64 emulator. The earliest was written for DOS using a mixture of DJGP C and x86 machine code; it worked pretty well and was released for DOS. A few years later I wrote a pure C using SDL library, it worked but was never released. Lastly the Java version never got off the ground, life got in the way.
